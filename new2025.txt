Although I have not yet completed the Kubernetes and Apache Airflow certifications, I dedicated significant time to studying both technologies over the past year. This preparation directly enabled me to support the deployment of the PDST and Airflow applications onto the E3 cloud infrastructure, which was a key milestone for both projects.

Through my Airflow studies—particularly materials from the Astronomer certification—I was able to design and implement several critical DAGs for internal teams, including creating custom role-based access controls (RBAC) that go beyond native Airflow functionality. This allowed project owners to restrict DAG visibility and permissions on a per-team basis, which aligned with our org’s security and ownership expectations. I also worked on dependency version management and system upgrades that improved the overall reliability of the shared Airflow instance for all departments using it.

Additionally, I authored and shared internal documentation on deploying Airflow to E3, which has served as a foundational resource for other teams looking to do the same. I also collaborated with the ODST team to support triggering Airflow DAGs via API calls, enabling task automation and integration across departments.

This goal not only enhanced my technical skills, but positioned me as a go-to resource for others looking to deploy, automate, and maintain cloud-native applications in our E3 environment.

Over the past year, I fully delivered on this goal by completing the migration of PDST resources from the unsupported CTL Rancher-managed Kubernetes cluster to the E3-managed environment. This move ensured that PDST is now hosted on a secure, actively maintained platform with a more up-to-date Kubernetes version, improving both stability and long-term support.

As part of this migration, I refactored PDST deployment configurations to integrate with Jenkins and ArgoCD, enabling automated builds and deployments triggered by Git commits. This reduced manual intervention and ensured that new features or changes could be deployed more reliably and consistently across environments.

To support better testing and release workflows, I also created a dedicated test namespace within the E3 cluster. This allowed the PDST team to test new versions in a sandboxed environment, avoiding any disruption to production services while promoting more confident iteration.

These efforts improved development velocity, reduced risk, and established a more scalable and modern deployment process for PDST — laying a foundation that can be reused by other teams and projects moving forward.

Over the past year, I played a key role in scaling the Airflow platform for enterprise-wide usage as part of the CAMP project. I prepared Airflow for production deployment on the E3 cloud environment, unlocking the Airflow API to enable teams such as Doltlab and PDST to trigger DAGs programmatically and automate key workflows.

To support cross-team adoption, I assisted other departments in connecting to the shared E3 Airflow instance and helped them troubleshoot deployment and migration issues. I also collaborated with teams to standardize best practices for DAG deployment and execution, improving consistency across projects and reducing onboarding friction.

These efforts ensured that Airflow was not only usable by CAMP, but also scalable and accessible for other teams. By positioning Airflow as a common orchestration tool across Aerospace, I helped improve process automation, reduce manual workload, and lay the groundwork for repeatable CI/CD practices across cloud-native applications.

Over the past year, I strengthened my impact at Aerospace by leading several cloud-native infrastructure efforts that helped modernize our internal workflows and enable cross-team automation. My contributions directly supported the enterprise-wide scaling of Airflow and the deployment of cloud-native apps like PDST on our E3 Kubernetes environment.

I collaborated across departments to help migrate and operationalize key applications in E3, which included refactoring PDST to support containerization and automated deployments using Helm, Jenkins, and ArgoCD. I also designed and built a dedicated testing namespace for PDST, allowing the team to safely validate updates without impacting production — a shift that reduced downtime risk and improved team velocity.

For the CAMP project, I prepared Airflow for production-readiness, helping enable integrations with internal applications like Doltlab and PDST through the Airflow API. I supported other teams in onboarding to the E3 Airflow instance, resolved deployment issues, and promoted best practices for DAG creation, RBAC, and dependency management. These efforts helped standardize automation across departments and established a scalable foundation for shared orchestration infrastructure.

Beyond technical work, I regularly assisted other teams in troubleshooting local Airflow setups, shared knowledge across project boundaries, and contributed to the organization’s broader shift toward repeatable cloud-native engineering workflows. My work not only addressed immediate project needs but also laid groundwork for future scalability, maintainability, and collaboration across Aerospace.
