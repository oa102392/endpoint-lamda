Key-Value Explanation:

id: "1268837246224846985"
This is the unique Spaceflake ID generated by the system, represented as a string to prevent precision loss when handling large numbers.
decompose: An object containing the detailed breakdown of the Spaceflake ID.
id: 1.268837246224847e+18
This is the numerical representation of the unique Spaceflake ID in scientific notation. It provides a clear numerical value for the ID, which can be useful for debugging, analysis, or systems where the ID needs to be processed as a number.
nodeID: 2
This indicates the node ID (in this case, node 2) which generated the ID. Each node within the StatefulSet is assigned a unique node ID to ensure the distributed generation of unique IDs.
sequence: 137
This represents the sequence number of the ID within the current millisecond. It starts at 0 and increments with each ID generated, up to a maximum of 4095. When it reaches the maximum, it rotates back to 0 in the next millisecond.
time: 1722584773356
This is the timestamp in milliseconds since the custom epoch (base time), indicating when the ID was generated. It ensures that the IDs are chronologically ordered.
workerID: 5
This indicates the worker ID (in this case, worker 5) within the node that generated the ID. Each node can have up to 32 workers, and each worker generates IDs independently, further ensuring uniqueness.
