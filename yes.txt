Goal: Advancing Search and Rescue Operations through the Development of the RASP Data Visualization Tool, Leveraging Cloud-Based Innovation and Fostering Active Collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security


The RASP project, short for "Rescue 21 Augmentation From Space," is a collaborative effort with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security aimed at boosting search and rescue capabilities using cloud-native technology. It focuses on developing a data visualization tool for displaying Digital Selective Calling (DSC) signals, essential for coordinating rescue missions. RASP seeks to enhance mission efficiency and success by integrating advanced technology into rescue operations.

As part of my commitment to continuous technical and professional development, I will focus on leveraging my expertise to mentor an associate member of technical staff on the key project, RASP. This will involve guiding them in enhancing their contributions to the codebase through effective coding practices, conducting thorough code reviews, and providing constructive feedback. I aim to facilitate a culture of learning and sharing by organizing weekly sessions to review demoed updates and discuss improvement areas. In addition, I aim to host a Tech Talk to discuss the technologies and methods used to develop the RASP data visualization tool such as Node.js, AWS Gov Cloud, AWS Lambda, and Kubernetes.

I will continue to support and collaborate with the U.S. Coast Guard after the completion and delivery of the RASP tool. My role will involve offering them support and training to maximize the use of the tool’s features. I will actively seek their feedback and use it as a means for the ongoing adaptation and improvement of the tool.


My contributions on the RASP project will have a positive impact on Aerospace and extend beyond code development as there will be a focus on mentoring and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. I'll mentor associate staff on the project, guiding them in advanced coding practices and encouraging a learning environment through weekly reviews and a Tech Talk on RASP's technologies like Node.js and AWS Gov Cloud. Post-delivery, I'll ensure the U.S. Coast Guard maximizes the RASP tool's benefits, offering support, and training, and incorporating their feedback for ongoing enhancements.


















Technical Excellence 

Goal: Technical Excellence through knowledge sharing and management of Cloud-Based Workflow Automation in the CAMP Project

The Continuous Architecture Management Pipeline (CAMP) project applies software development and project management best practices to engineering data and analysis workflows. CAMP introduces a new capability that streamlines and enhances the analytical processes at Aerospace and sets a new standard for how projects are managed and executed within the organization.

In my role as the implementation developer for Airflow for the CAMP project, I am tasked with driving technical excellence through the implementation of cloud-based workflow automation. This involves setting up Apache Airflow on E3 to automate and orchestrate engineering workflows. 

The key contributions on my efforts on the CAMP project will aim at educating and documenting on how to stand up, maintain, and utilize Apache Airflow on E3. Creating detailed documentation for other members in Aerospace on how to set up, deploy, and mange Apache Airflow on E3 will be a priority. Additionally, documenting lessons learned will provide valuable insight for the future. Framework and resource sharing will be another effort where I will make it available for others in Aerospace to obtain the software framework such as Helm charts, container images, and best practices derived from the project. I will facilitate the reuse of these resources across Aerospace. In addition, I will assist in the management of the workflow automation features that Airflow offers and support in adding features needed by the rest of the CAMP team such as adding SSO authentication, DAG sync and management (workflows), updating of the underlying software and more.

My contributions to the CAMP project will have a positive impact on Aerospace by fulfilling the technical requirements of setting up and managing Apache Airflow but also by incorporating the organization’s commitment to technical excellence. Technical excellence will be achieved by documenting and knowledge sharing of the workflow automation and lessons learned, making framework and resources available to others in Aerospace, and leading the required changes and updates needed to the workflow automation instance the CAMP team will utilize. 





















Enterprise:

Goal: Driving Enterprise Integration and Mission Success through Workflow Development and Cloud Development with the AWESOME project

The AWESOME (Aerospace Wargame Effectiveness Simulation On Multiplayer Environment) project is a distributed framework that integrates multiple aerospace tools. It facilitates the exchange of over-the-wire data during live simulations, enabling comprehensive enterprise analyses and interactive wargaming. This project represents a significant advancement in how Aerospace conducts simulations and analyses.

As a key developer on the AWESOME project, my role focuses on building workflow automation functionality using Python, FastAPI, Faust, MongoDB, and Kafka. I will assist in the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for the AWESOME applications on the cloud by utilizing technologies such as Helm, ArgoCD, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. I will ensure reliable deployment, management, and scaling of AWESOME applications on E3. By working on these areas, I aim to facilitate the successful migration of AWESOME to Aerospace’s cloud provider E3.

My contributions to the AWESOME project will have a positive impact to the Aerospace organization because it will advocate for the adoption of cloud architectures for future development of Aerospace technologies and tools.
