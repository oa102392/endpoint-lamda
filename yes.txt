To validate the performance and reliability of the Spaceflake application, a load test was performed using Locust. The test simulated 100,000 concurrent users, ramping up at a rate of 1,000 users per second. Throughout the test, the system successfully handled a total of 253,083 requests, maintaining an average rate of 1,500 requests per second with zero failures.

The generated Spaceflake IDs (UUIDs) from these requests were saved into a text file for uniqueness verification. Subsequent analysis confirmed that all the IDs were unique, demonstrating the robustness of the Spaceflake ID generation mechanism even under high load conditions. These results highlight the system's capability to manage significant traffic while ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of the generated IDs, making it well-suited for production environments.
