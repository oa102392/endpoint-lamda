You can indeed track users using JWT stored in cookies, but it's important to understand the characteristics of this approach and what "tracking" entails in this context.

JWT and User Tracking
When you use JWTs stored in cookies for authentication, each request from a client includes the JWT, which the server verifies. Here's how tracking works in this scenario:

Statelessness: JWT is self-contained and carries all necessary information about the user, which the server uses to authenticate and potentially authorize the request without needing to retrieve user session data from a database or memory store. This is the essence of statelessnessâ€”each request is independent.

User Identification: The JWT typically includes a payload with claims about the user, such as a user ID, roles, and other attributes. When a request is made, the server decodes the JWT to identify the user and make authorization decisions based on the claims within the token.

Tracking User Activity
If by "tracking," you mean monitoring user activities or maintaining state across requests (like tracking a user's progress through a form or a multi-step process within your application), you can still achieve this with JWTs by:

Storing Activity State in the Client: For purely client-side activities, store progress in the client's local storage or in the state of your frontend application (e.g., a React state).

Sending State with Requests: For server-side tracking, include relevant state information in your requests from the client to the server. The server can then process this information as needed, potentially logging activities or making decisions based on the state included with the request.

Advantages and Considerations
Scalability and Simplicity: This approach scales well because it reduces the server's workload in managing session states. It fits well with microservices architectures and serverless computing, where applications might run across many distributed nodes.

Security Considerations: Ensure the JWT is securely transmitted and stored. Use HTTPS to prevent interception of the token, and set the HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies to mitigate the risk of client-side script access and interception.

Data Freshness: Since JWTs are stateless, the information within the token remains static until it expires. If you need to reflect changes in user permissions or other attributes during an active session, you might need mechanisms to invalidate the current token and issue a new one with updated claims.



User Authentication with Passport Local Strategy
Login Request: When a user submits their credentials (username and password) through a login form, the Passport Local strategy validates these credentials against the database or any other user store.

Session Creation: Upon successful authentication, Passport initiates a session for the user. This involves creating a unique session identifier (session ID) and storing it in a session store, which could be in-memory, a database, Redis, etc.

Storing Session ID in Cookies: The server sends the session ID back to the client's browser as a cookie. This cookie is then included automatically by the browser in subsequent requests to the server.

Tracking User Activity
Session Retrieval: With each request, the server retrieves the session ID from the cookie, looks up the corresponding session in the session store, and re-establishes the session context for the request. This allows the server to recognize the user and maintain state across requests.

Storing User Data: The session can store data related to the user's activities. For example, you might track the user's navigation path, store items in a shopping cart, or keep form inputs for multi-step processes. This data is associated with the user's session ID and can be accessed server-side during the session's lifecycle.

Middleware for User Tracking: You can create or use existing middleware in your Node.js application to perform custom tracking of user activities. This might involve logging actions, monitoring user behavior, or applying business logic based on the user's session data.

Advantages and Considerations
Simplicity: Using sessions with Passport is straightforward and well-supported, making it easy to implement user authentication and activity tracking.

Statefulness: Since the session data is stored server-side, it's inherently stateful. This allows for rich, context-aware applications but requires careful management of session data to ensure performance and scalability.

Security: It's essential to implement security measures to protect session data, including using secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent access from client-side scripts, implementing CSRF protection, and managing session expiration and invalidation properly.

Scalability: For applications that expect to scale, consider how session data is stored and managed. Using in-memory storage can quickly become a bottleneck. External session stores like Redis are often used to improve scalability and performance in distributed environments.
